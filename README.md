### Initial objectives
| Issues & Goals	| . | Description 	| Prototype (Version 0.1) |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| FPS & 3PP camera | . | Lua scripts and input bindings capable of controlling the character camera with the mouse. Shifting the camera(s) view is done with a key-event (F4) | Prototyped |

| | . | | |
| Rotation of Objects | . | Rotate an object on its own axis. As if it is an item on display | Prototyped |
| Reuseability | . | Issue: if you assign the same script to more than one Lua Script Component, only one object rotates | TODO |
| | . | | |
